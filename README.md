# E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of **8,399 e-commerce order records** to uncover trends in sales, profit, and customer behavior. Using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Plotly**, and **Power BI**, the project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive actionable insights for optimizing profitability and understanding customer segments.

**Dataset Source**: `E-COMMERCE.xls` (not included in the repository due to sensitivity; available upon request).  
**Dataset Size**: 8,399 records, 21 columns (e.g., Order ID, Order Date, Order Quantity, Sales, Profit, Customer Segment, Product Category, Product Sub-Category, Ship Mode).

### Preprocessing
- Cleaned data using **Pandas** to handle inconsistencies in order and product details.
- Standardized fields for consistent analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Plotly (Express and Graph Objects), NumPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Power BI
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

- **Profit by Category**: The Technology category contributed **~48%** of the total profit share (based on Plotly pie chart).
- **Profit by Sub-Category**: Copiers and Phones were the highest profit-generating sub-categories, while Tables incurred losses (from Plotly bar chart).
- **Customer Segment Analysis**: The Home Office segment had the best sales-to-profit ratio (**7.13**) compared to Consumer (**8.66**), indicating higher profitability per sale.

## Visualizations

- **Pie Chart**: Profit distribution across product categories (Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture).
- **Bar Chart**: Profit by product sub-categories (e.g., Copiers, Phones, Tables).
- **Bar Chart**: Sales and profit by customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Interactive visualizations for sales trends, profit analysis, and segment performance (screenshots available in the repository).
